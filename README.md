# XV2_Shaders
XV2 Pixel Shaders that have been decompiled and re-written for readability and easier use.
I'm still learning HLSL, so it may not be the best, but I did the best I could to closely replicate the original math and such as best I could.
"TOON_UNIF_Base.hlsl" is the basic body/clothing shader and has macro to enable compiling as the various different shader types XV2 uses.

Macros are:
- USE_STAIN2
- USE_STAIN3
- USE_ATH
- USE_MSK
- USE_D2
- USE_XVM
- USE_MUD
- USE_OWR
- USE_NRP
